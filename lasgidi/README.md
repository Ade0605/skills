# Lasgidi

A Lagos life simulator that runs in any browser, on any phone, even offline.

Work shifts, hustle gigs, sleep through NEPA, take the danfo or the ferry, join an ajo, dodge the loan apps and the Ponzi schemes. Rent is due every Saturday at noon.

Lasgidi is an original game inspired by the viral *Lagos Life*. It is designed to fix that game's weak spots: a broken economy, chat that would not scale, weak retention and a heavy 3D world. The full analysis is in [`docs/REVIEW.md`](docs/REVIEW.md).

## Play

```sh
cd lasgidi
python3 -m http.server 8080      # or: npm run serve
# open http://localhost:8080
```

There is no build step. It is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript at about 120 KB. Served over HTTPS (or from localhost), it installs as a PWA and works offline.

To get a single self-contained file:

```sh
node tools/build-single.js       # writes dist/lasgidi.html
```

## Test

```sh
npm test
```

The test suite runs the engine under Node. It covers rent and eviction, travel rules, rush hour, jobs and promotion, getting sacked, connects, ajo, loan compounding, overdraft guards, save round-trips and tamper detection, choice events and hospital collapse. It includes a **30-week bot playthrough for each birth-lottery origin** that checks after every step that the ledger reconciles and that the economy stays bounded. A second bot plays only by following the advisor and must survive and get promoted.

## How it plays

- **Birth lottery:** LAPO Baby (50%), Ajepako (35%) or Nepo Baby (15%). This sets your starting cash and home. A Nepo Baby's allowance ends after 8 weeks.
- **Goals:** Japa (IELTS plus ₦15m proof of funds), Landlord (own a house), Odogwu (top of a career) or Freestyle.
- **Needs:** Belle, energy, enjoyment, social, hygiene and calm. Neglect them and you end up in General Hospital.
- **Districts:** 12 in total. Ikeja, Ikorodu, Oshodi, Mushin, Festac, Surulere and Yaba are on the mainland. Lagos Island, Ikoyi, VI, Lekki and Ajah are on the Island.
- **Transport:** 8 modes. Keke cannot cross the bridges, BRT and the ferry run only between their stops, and okada carries task-force risk in the ban areas. Go-slow peaks 06–10 and 16–21.
- **Careers:** 9 careers × 5 levels, from Dispatch Rider to Logistics Boss and from Backup Singer to Afrobeats Giant.
- **Money:** cash and bank, ajo, three kinds of loan, businesses that need your attention, property and a car. Every transaction shows as a bank alert and lands on a sealed statement.
- **Events:** grid collapse, fuel scarcity, floods, black tax, BVN scam texts, Ponzi schemes, landlord hikes, owambe aso-ebi, checkpoints and area boys. Detty December arrives in week 9.
- **Policy vote:** every 4 weeks you vote on a governorship policy that changes the rules for a month.
- **Advisor ("Wetin I go do?"):** up to three next moves, each one tap away. It tells you when to leave so you're on time, picks the cheapest ride that still arrives on time, warns when a shift would make you collapse, and suggests a gig when rent is due and you're short.
- **Sleep with alarm:** wakes you in time to commute to your next shift.
- **Weekly report card:** every Monday you see money in and out by category, the change in your net worth and a chart of it by week. A one-tap share text is ready for X or WhatsApp.
- **Every district has a hustle,** so a broke player is never stranded.

The engine is deterministic: all randomness comes from a seeded PRNG kept in the save. Only `post()` can change cash or bank. That makes the engine ready to run on a server for a future multiplayer version (see the roadmap in the review).
